### Encoders
- **Layer 0 Encoder**: Control Undo/Redo or object forward/backward functionality.
- **Layer 1 Encoder**: Adjust placement using bracket operations for more granular control.

## How to Use

1. **Install**: Connect the **Work Louder Micro** and load the configuration.
2. **Switch Layers**: Use the `Switch Layer` key to toggle between layers for different Figma actions.
3. **Custom Macros**: Customize the layout by editing the `creator_micro.layout.json` file for specific workflows.
4. **App Customization**: Use the [Via App](https://usevia.app/) to easily adjust the layout, macros, and encoder settings.
5. **Component & Auto Layout**: Manage auto layout and component creation directly from the macro pad.

## Customization
You can modify the key bindings and layers by using the **Via App**. The `creator_micro.layout.json` includes:

- **Macros**: Key bindings for repeated actions.
- **Layers**: Four layers, each with different shortcut combinations for Figma.
- **Encoders**: Additional rotary controls for more precise operations.

The [Via App](https://usevia.app/) allows you to further customize these shortcuts and create macros tailored to your specific workflow.

## JSON Layout Structure

The layout structure is flexible for customization:
- **Layers**: Pre-configured with Figma operations, easily modified.
- **Macros**: Define custom shortcuts to streamline repetitive tasks.
- **Encoders**: Programmable encoders for undo/redo, object adjustments, etc.

For advanced configuration, use the Via App or refer to the JSON file directly.
